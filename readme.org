This module provides a minor mode called org-roam-gt that
provides two major improvements to org-roam:

1. it improves significantly the speed of ~org-roam-node-find~

2. The template passed to ~org-roam-node-find~ can be a function.
  This improves its performance significantly. 
    You can still pass a string, but I recommend you rewrite it as
    a function. See org-roam-gt-default-format below which replaces
    the default org-roam template
    
3. it adds a submenu to org-speed-commands (accessible via 'm')

How to use:
 
 Simply enable the mode:

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp   :exports both
  (org-roam-gt-mode)
 #+end_src

 to disable, running the command again

 #+begin_src    :exports both
  (org-roam-gt-mode)
 #+end_src
